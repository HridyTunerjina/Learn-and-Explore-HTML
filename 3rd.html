<p>Headings in HTML are essential elements used to organize <small>content</small> on a webpage. They are created using heading tags, ranging from h1 to h6, with h1 being the most significant and largest, and h6 the least important and smallest. These tags help break up text into sections, making it easier for users to read and navigate content.</p>

<p>Headings also play a crucial role in SEO (Search Engine Optimization), as search engines use them to understand the structure and relevance of content on your site. Proper use of heading tags can enhance both accessibility and the user experience, making your content more organized and discoverable.</p>
