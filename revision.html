<p>Hyper-Text Markup Language</p>

<p>HTML <b>(HyperText Markup Language)</b> is the <strong>standard language</strong> used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the structure of web pages using a series of elements or tags, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. HTML tells the web browser how to display text, images, and other content on a webpage. It is the foundation of all websites and is typically used in combination with <em>CSS</em> (for styling) and <i>JavaScript</i> (for interactivity) to create a complete web page.</p>
